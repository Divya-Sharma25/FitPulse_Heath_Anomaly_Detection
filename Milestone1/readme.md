**Milestone 1 — Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Created/ingested sample fitness dataset (timestamped 5-minute readings)
- Cleaned missing values, clipped unrealistic outliers
- Resampled / aligned data to fixed 5-minute frequency
- Produced cleaned series for `heart_rate`, `step_count`, `sleep(duration_minutes)`
