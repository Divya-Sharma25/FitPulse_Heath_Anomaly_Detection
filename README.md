# FitPulse — Health Anomaly Detection
**Infosys Springboard Internship 6.0**

**Project problem statement**  
Fitness devices generate vast amounts of noisy time-series data with irregularities and anomalies that can mask critical health signals. This makes it difficult to identify meaningful patterns and detect early signs of health issues.

**Objective**  
Develop a robust pipeline to ingest, clean and align fitness device data to enable accurate anomaly detection for early health issue identification and intervention.
